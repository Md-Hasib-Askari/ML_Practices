# Beginner Level: Foundations & Essentials 

**1. Linear Regression from Scratch**  
- Build a simple linear regression model in Python using only NumPy.
- Dataset: Predict house prices based on square footage.

**2. Logistic Regression for Binary Classification**  
- Classify whether a student will pass based on study hours.
- Visualize the decision boundary.

**3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- Classify handwritten digits (use a subset of MNIST).
- Implement it from scratch and with scikit-learn.

**4. Decision Trees**
- Train a decision tree on the Titanic dataset (survivor prediction).
- Visualize the tree using Graphviz.

**5. Cross-Validation & Performance Metrics**
- Use cross-validation to evaluate models.
- Implement precision, recall, F1-score manually.

# Intermediate Level: Deeper Models & Feature Engineering

**6. Naive Bayes for Text Classification**
- Spam detection using SMS spam dataset.
- Preprocess text using TF-IDF.

**7. Feature Engineering Challenge**
- Work on the Ames Housing dataset.
- Create new features, handle missing values, normalize data.

**8. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use GridSearchCV/RandomSearchCV on an SVM model.
- Dataset: Digits or Wine dataset.

**9. Ensemble Methods**
- Implement and compare Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.
